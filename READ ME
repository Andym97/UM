Modules- Load Execute Segments 
 
Simply loads a program from file and stores into memory, one instruction at a time. 
 
Execute decides which of the 13 instructions to perform based on the opcode given after the instructions have been finished loading. 
 
Segments handles the mapping and unmapping segments ensuring there is no memory loss. 
 
For 50 million instructions, I am unsure on how long that would take take the program to run.
For reference,running midmark.um took the program about 6.5 seconds
